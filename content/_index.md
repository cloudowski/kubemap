<h2 itemprop="headline">What is it?</h2>
<div id="post">
    Kubemap presents Kubernetes objects (or resources if you prefer) with relationships
    and connections between them.
    This may help people who learn better with diagrams and maps to understand how they interact with each other.
</div>

<h2 itemprop="headline">How to use it?</h2>
<div id="post">
    You may want to use zoom in your browser, as currently the map does not support zooming itself. Some objects have additional data as tooltips (just hover over them to see more info) or links to a page with more details.
