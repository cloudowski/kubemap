<h2 itemprop="headline">What is it?</h2>
<div id="post">
    Kubemap presents Kubernetes objects (or resources if you prefer) with relationships
    and connections between them.
    This may help people who learn better with diagrams and maps to understand how they interact with each other.
</div>

<h2 itemprop="headline">How to use it?</h2>
<div id="post">
    You may want to use zoom in your browser, as currently the map does not support zooming itself. Click on a object to see a page with more details (for some reasons your mouse cursor doesn't change when you hover over, but it has a proper link).
