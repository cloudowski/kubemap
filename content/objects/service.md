Service is an abstraction layer that configures underlying network infrastructure to provide an access to ports exposed by a [Pod]({{< ref "pod" >}}).

There are four types of Service:

* **ClusterIP** - basic and default type which provides an fixed, virtual address (accesible **ONLY** from inside a cluster) and DNS name if dns addon is installed 
* **NodePort** - configures the same things as ClusterIP and additionally opens a dedicated port on **every** node in a cluster; this port directs traffic to any available and ready pod regardless which node it is running on
* **LoadBalancer** - configures the same things as NodePort and additionally it creates a load balancer service on a platform that a cluster is running on; useful mostly on cloud platforms
* **ExternalName** - only adds a record in internal , cluster DNS server
